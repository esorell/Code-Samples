         <div class="stage-description">
        		<p>Susan will take on students at any time during their high school career. It is advisable for athletes to start as soon as possible to ensure appropriate course selection and NCAA eligibility compliance. Non-athletes applying to US or European schools should ideally commence the process in the fall or winter of Grade 11. This timing allows for transcript review and course selection to meet admission requirements at highly selective colleges, proper preparation for and scheduling of standardized tests and sufficient time for campus visits. Students applying to Canadian schools can start any time but preferably before the fall of Grade 12.</p><br>
<p>The final year of high school can be pressure filled. An early start to the post-secondary discovery, selection and application process results in a less stressful and more enjoyable experience for all.</p>

       			<p>Susan takes the time to get to know and understand her students first so that she can help them find the best possible post-secondary options from an academic, intellectual, social, athletic or arts standpoint. The initial session with the student and parents provides the opportunity to understand her philosophy and services, ensure that there is a good fit and establish that all parties are comfortable with the process. A hallmark of her practice is helping her students explore their strengths, aptitudes, interests and goals resulting in the students’ attainment of a deeper level of self-understanding.  This is an invaluable asset during the interview and application process.</p>

        		<p>Susan invests time and energy in visiting campuses in Canada and the United States and knows that the information found in websites and brochures does not provide a complete picture. With her understanding of the nuances, culture, atmosphere and environment of many university and college campuses she is able to provide direction on finding a school where the student not only gets an education but thrives.</p><br>
                
				<p>From this knowledge base, Susan works with students to create a list of schools in the United States, Canada or both that may be a good fit for them, resulting in a truly fulfilling post-secondary experience. The creation of the list is a fluid process as interests, attitudes and goals evolve over the high school years. As the application season approaches Susan helps students to prepare for campus visits and interviews and meets with them afterwards to discuss their experiences and impressions.

            <div class="stage-description">
        		<p>Standardized testing can be a critical component of the application process for certain programs and institutions. Susan works with students to develop a standardized testing strategy encompassing the choice and timing of tests.  Where appropriate, Susan will explore “test optional” schools with her students. She also reviews the students’ current high school transcript and assists in course selection keeping in mind the academic requirements of the students’ targeted schools and if applicable, NCAA eligibility. </p>

            <div class="stage-description">
        		<p>At application time Susan collaborates with the student to determine where to apply and under what program (ED, EA, RD) She will determine who and how to ask for letters of recommendation and will oversee the completion of the Common Application. With her background in English and Law, Susan has strong language skills and assists in brainstorming and reviewing applications and essays.  Providing feedback and encouragement throughout the process, she works closely with students to ensure that their unique voice is heard.</p><br>
        		<p>Susan will also work with students regarding the composition and submission of portfolios where required by specific schools and programs.</p>

        		<p>One of Susan’s specialties is working with high-performance athletes. She provides guidance to student athletes and their parents with respect to the NCAA process.  Susan will work on initial eligibility and then develop a plan to increase exposure and assist with communication with coaches and campus visits. </p>

        		<p>At decision time Susan will objectively work with the student to thoroughly assess their options. Recognizing that students and families all have their own unique priorities, she will highlight the factors that students can use in their decision-making process.</p><br>
<p>College and university admissions are wildly competitive. Admission to a student’s dream school cannot be guaranteed. What can be guaranteed is that the student will grow, engage in self-discovery, and develop helpful life-skills while travelling this journey. Susan derives great joy from watching her students develop, mature and find their voice as they go through the process together.</p>
